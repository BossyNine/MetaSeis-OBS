#### Project 
The objective of this project is to develop a solution that converts scanned log files into a structured CSV format, with future support for JSON output. This conversion will facilitate efficient metadata extraction and support the long-term archiving and management of data within a repository system (PANGAEA).  


The PDF files (sourcedata) contain scanned logs documenting the instrumentâ€™s deployment and subsequent recovery.
